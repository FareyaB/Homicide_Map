#Homicide Hotspot Analysis 🔍

A Data Mining Approach to Crime Prediction

This project applies data mining techniques to analyze homicide trends using crime data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). By integrating temporal, spatial, and demographic features, we identify patterns and predictors of criminal activity to support crime prevention efforts.

🔹 Key Features

✔ Comprehensive Crime Data – Covers multiple years (2018–2023) of U.S. crime reports
✔ Feature Engineering – Extracts time-based, geographic, and demographic attributes
✔ Predictive Modeling – Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier for homicide prediction
✔ Geospatial Analysis – Maps crime hotspots at the county level
✔ High Model Accuracy – Achieved 99.39% accuracy in homicide predictions

📊 Methodology

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends using descriptive statistics & visualizations
3️⃣ Machine Learning Model – Training & evaluating a Random Forest model
4️⃣ Crime Hotspot Detection – Predicting high-risk areas for proactive law enforcement

📈 Results & Impact

Key Findings: Homicides peak during late-night hours and weekends, influenced by population density and offender-victim relationships
Future Scope: Expand to all crime types, incorporate socioeconomic data, and enhance predictive accuracy with deep learning
